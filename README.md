## Tom's Movie Database

My Movie Database is a movie-info style application.

This repository is all the code for the full application, that uses react on the front end to render in all the components need that are retrieved from the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/en). To view the deployed version of this site please click this [link](https://t-moviesdb.netlify.com/).

Within the application, you can view movies, tv show, actors, detailed information about given movies/series, and I will also integrate all media for a given genre and for a specific person.
